# Rookcount

Provided is a program `count_mins` that may be compiled by executing `make`. Its primary purpose is to either compute minimal covering rook placements for a given board size through a brute force method, or to approximate them with an algorithm that fills in unattacked diagonal slices in increasing order. Details on its operation may be given by executing `./countmins -h`.
